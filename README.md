# Computer Vision Project Report

**Project Name**: Pendeteksi Jenis Motor (Motorcycle Type Detection)  
**Student Name**: Bethania Simangunsong  
**Course/Institution**: Computer Vision/Politeknik Caltex Riau  

## Background
In the development of modern computer technology, computer vision has become one of the fields widely used to support automation in daily life. One of its implementations is in object recognition, including motor vehicles. This Motorcycle Type Detection project aims to automatically identify motorcycle types based on visual images, thereby improving efficiency in surveillance systems, parking management, or traffic data collection.

## Problem Statement
To design and build a computer vision-based system capable of accurately identifying motorcycle types from images.

## Scope of the Problem
- Recognizable motorcycle types:
    a) Motor Bebek
    b) Motor Matic
    c) Motor Sport
    d) Motor Trail
    e) Motor Listrik

- Input is a side-view image of the motorcycle
- Dataset contains approximately Â±1500 images per category from Roboflow
- The system is developed using Python and YOLOv8
  
## Objectives
- To detect and classify motorcycle types
- To produce automatic classification results with high accuracy

## Benefit
- Supports vehicle monitoring and management systems

## Tools & Technologies
- Programming Language: Python
- Object Detection: YOLOv8
- Dataset: Roboflow https://universe.roboflow.com/bethaniaworkspace/motorcycledetection-plboa

## Prediction Results
- The model has not yet detected accurately
- Current prediction accuracy: 5.11%
